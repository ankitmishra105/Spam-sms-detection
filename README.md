🚀 Spam SMS Detection Model
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as Spam or Legitimate (Ham). As part of Task 1 of the CodeSoft Internship, I explored various classification algorithms and evaluated their performance on a labeled SMS dataset.

📌 Project Overview
Applied text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF).

Trained and evaluated multiple classification models.

Compared model accuracies to identify the best-performing algorithm.

🧠 Algorithms Used & Performance
Model	Accuracy
Naive Bayes	96.68%
Logistic Regression	95.25%
Support Vector Machine	97.85%

📁 Task
Task 1 – Spam SMS Detection Model under the CodeSoft Machine Learning Internship Program

✅ Outcome
Successfully implemented and tested a spam detection pipeline with high accuracy, demonstrating practical knowledge in text classification using machine learning.
